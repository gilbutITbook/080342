These files are the examples from
[*Efficient Linux at the Command Line*](https://efficientlinux.com/)
by [Daniel J. Barrett](https://danieljbarrett.com/). With these files on your Linux computer,
you'll be able to run the book's sample commands exactly as
written. Just `cd` to the appropriate directory and run the
commands. The example files are organized by chapter and section.
