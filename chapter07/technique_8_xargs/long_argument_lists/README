To create 1,000,000 files named file1.txt through file1000000.txt,
first make sure you have at least a few million inodes free on the disk
holding your /tmp directory. Run this command and examine the IFree value:

  df -i /tmp

If you have enough inodes, make and enter a temporary directory:

  cd /tmp
  mkdir million
  cd million

Then run this command:

  echo file{1..1000000}.txt | xargs touch

It may take a few minutes to run.
